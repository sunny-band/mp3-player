# ðŸŽµ Python MP3 Player

This is a small personal project I made to get back into programming. Since I enjoy music and had some past experience with Python, I thought building a simple MP3 player would be a fun way to brush up on my skills.

Libraries used:
- **Tkinter** â€“ for GUI
- **Pygame** â€“ for audio playback
- **PIL (Pillow)** â€“ for handling button images



Currently functional:
- Play/Stop button functionality
- Load MP3 files (multiple) via file dialog



Need to implement in the future:
- The rest of the button functionalities: Prev/Next/Pause
- Queueing up/playing the next song automatically (if there are multiple MP3 files)
- Shuffle & repeat functions
- Display an album cover associated with the MP3 file
- Sliders for volume & song length
- Add a visualizer (similarly to Windows Media Player)
